# web-scraping-med-puppeteer-abbmarand
## intro
    this project scrapes and has a simple visualisation/usage of the data
    the intended way to use this data is trough another project of mine where the commands are the same but you can use it in the game of rust
    https://github.com/abbmarand/better_rustplus.git
    
    my focus with this project has been to get as accurate data as possible as I will use it for future projects
    you may notice that the visualisation doesnt't utalize everything of which is scraped as the focus has been on the data
## usage
    clone the repository https://github.com/abbindustrigymnasium/web-scraping-med-puppeteer-abbmarand.git
    run the scrape.js file to get all the data saved to your machine or just use the data which exists in the repository now

    once you have the data, run the input.js file and try the commands
        !craft assault-rifle 2
        !recycle assault-rifle 4
